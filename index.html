     Flowers not only have the power of cheering us up when we are feeling down, but they also have many other properties such as helping us get a proper night of sleep, boosting our creativity, increasing our productivity, making our tolerance to pain higher, boosting our health, and even improving our attention span.
    The researches demonstrate that workers’ idea generation, creative performance and problem-solving skills improve substantially in workplace environments that include flowers and plants.
    
    Classrooms with flowers and plants in it have a bigger attendance span, and students show more creativity, free-thinking skills, and overall satisfaction.
     Fill your home with blooms to keep your mind distracted from the day-to-day stress of life. Place them in your bedroom to wake up to a soothing and cheering view every morning, or to help you get a nice and relaxing night of sleep (choose flowers like Lavender, Jasmine or Gardenia.
     Flowers also help you create intimate connections and strengthen bonds with family and friends, which, ultimately, leads to a happier, more fulfilled life.
      COLOR-CHARACTERISTICS: 
In addition, color plays a big part in the emotion conveyed when sending flowers. According to Leatrice Eiseman, Executive Director of the Pantone Color Institute, “Our response to color is intensely emotional, and flowers can be a catalyst for feelings that stimulate more than just our senses of sight and smell.”

Tradition dictates that certain flowers and colors are associated with specific occasions. However, in terms of emotional health, color choices take on different meanings.  Red, traditionally associated with love and romance, has a positive effect on the immune system. Consider sending red flowers to someone who has recently had surgery, or experienced and illness. Red is also an energizing color for those who suffer from fatigue or exhaustion.
